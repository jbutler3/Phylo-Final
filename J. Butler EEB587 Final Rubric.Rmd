**Final project is worth 100 pts**

Main question: For a Fissidens phylogeny, which combination of genes provides the best resolution?

Which genes are most important for understanding the monophyly of Fissidens and its clades?
------------------

20 pts: Obtain alignments and generate concatenations for each combination 

25 pts: Generate bootstrap trees utilizing RAxML for each combination

25 pts: Create a data frame for the b.s. values and create plots that best convey results

30 pts: Create a rooted consensus tree and interpret the results.

Total:      /100
