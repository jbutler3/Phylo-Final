**Final project is worth 100 pts**

Main question: For a Fissidens phylogeny of 104 taxa, which combination of genes provides the best resolution?

Which genes are most important for understanding the monophyly of Fissidens?
------------------

20 pts: Obtain genetic data and build alignments

30 pts: Successfully set up and run each gene and combination of genes and get bootstrap supports for each combo

20 pts: Create plots that best convey results

30 pts: Analyze how each gene helps/hurts support.

Total:      /100
